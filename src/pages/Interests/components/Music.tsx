        Music has always been my constant companion—something that inspires me,
        energizes me, and sometimes helps me slow down. My taste is wildly
        diverse, shifting from hip hop to rock to classic 80s pop depending on
        the mood.

        I love everything from Linkin Park’s raw emotion to Queen’s iconic
        energy, from Green Day’s punchy attitude to Seedhe Maut’s bold
        storytelling. For me, music isn’t just a hobby—it’s a way to feel alive,
        connect with people, and discover new emotions every day.
